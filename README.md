## Architectural Principles Summary
1. **Safety First (Zero Risk to Campus):** Built-in simulation targets only authorized loopback or isolated lab subnets. Public IPs are strictly blocked by guardrail code.
2. **Student & Faculty Privacy:** Layer 7 packet payloads are pruned in memory immediately after transport-layer header dissection. No personal browsing content is ever stored.
3. **Dual-Engine Precision:** Deterministic rules provide instantaneous zero-false-positive catches for known signatures (e.g., SYN floods, port scans), while Scikit-learn (Random Forest + Isolation Forest) catches statistical and zero-day anomalies.
4. **Resilient Decoupling:** Packet sniffing operates asynchronously in background worker threads, preventing heavy capture traffic from blocking the FastAPI web server or WebSocket telemetry.
5. **Demonstration Reliability:** The system can run in **Pure Simulation Mode** on a single laptop without internet, administrative Wi-Fi permissions, or special hardware, ensuring 100% reliability during viva examinations.
